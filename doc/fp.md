# What is Functional Programming?

**Functional programming** produces programs by composing mathematical functions and avoids shared state & mutable data. Lisp (specified in 1958) was among the first languages to support functional programming, and was heavily inspired by lambda calculus.

A critical JavaScript programming paradigm every JS developer should learn. See ["The Two Pillars of JavaScript Pt 2"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4).
